Well it&#039;s not that easy as it might sound.

Here are values responsible for content layout. First one if sor sidebar and second one one is for content. The main goal here is to get 100% as the result when combining all these values. 
 
&lt;pre&gt;
#secondary {
	margin-left: 3.06%;
	width: 31.28%;
}
#primary {
	margin-left: 3.06%;
	width: 65.64%;
}	
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add them to Theme Options - Other - Custom CSS and start tweaking these values.]]></description>

Ok, I see. That&#039;s my bad since I tested it only via Chrome Development Tools. 

Replace previously given code with this one and see if that works 
&lt;pre&gt;
.back-to-top {
	left: 18px;
	max-width: 40px
}
&lt;/pre&gt;]]></description>

It is possible, however, you will have to use plugin or enable it via functions.php. I guess the simpler method will be to get this done by using plugin. 

Here is one of those plugins which will enable excerpt field for pages: http://wordpress.org/plugins/page-excerpt/]]></description>

I haven&#039;t done so yet, but I will at the moment. Thanks again for your support. People like you doesn&#039;t being born everyday ! Thanks again for the support. 

I have done what you said, but instead of moving the back to top button, it just add width and, I thought that I had done a mistake, so i removed the &quot;doth&quot; before back-to-top, and it just froze the background !]]></description>

This text is called Excerpt and it can be controlled for each Post individually. When editing Posts you will see a field called Excerpt under Post Edit area and this is where you can add your custom text. 
If you can&#039;t see Excerpt field you can enable it via Screen Options on the upper right corner in Post Edit view.]]></description>

Thank you for your outstanding feedback! Glad you like this theme. 

Actually it is very easy to move back to top button from right to left. You just need to add this to Them Options - Other - Custom CSS. 
&lt;pre&gt;
.back-to-top {
	left: 18px;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

I don&#039;t know if you already did but I would highly appreciate if you could rate/review this theme on WordPress.org : http://wordpress.org/support/view/theme-reviews/travelify?filter=5]]></description>

It&#039;s how it should be. I decided to leave users with some freedom since most users don&#039;t want featured images to be visible in Post pages automatically, however you can insert them manually in the post like any other image. Basically you set it once for featured image and then insert the same image in the post with a single upload. 

If I would have left an options for featured images to be visible in Posts, users who don&#039;t like to see these images they would have to do some custom coding. 

I hope you got an idea.]]></description>

Font is defined is several places so it might be a bit tricky to change it. 
For title I used Ubuntu font from Google Library. Most other is Helvetica with some exceptions.

Just to change body font you can add this to Theme Options - Other - Custom CSS

&lt;pre&gt;
body,input,textarea,article {
	font: 14px Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

And replace font name with one you would like to use. Make sure you leave a fallback font in case first font can&#039;t be found on visitors computer. For example I have defined it that Helvetica is the main font but if it&#039;s not it visitors computer it will fall back to &quot;sans-serif&quot; which is any device you can think of.]]></description>

<p>And replace font name with one you would like to use. Make sure you leave a fallback font in case first font can&#8217;t be found on visitors computer. For example I have defined it that Helvetica is the main font but if it&#8217;s not it visitors computer it will fall back to &#8220;sans-serif&#8221; which is any device you can think of.</p>

It is not possible unless you use Full Content Display Blog Template. However, you can achieve this by replacing featured image with video using plugin like this one: http://wordpress.org/plugins/featured-video-plus/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to get videos to show up directly on my homepage when I post a video only. For example I&#039;m trying to link a movie trailer, I add the youtube link in new posts and it works fine on it&#039;s on page but on my home page it only displays the title of the post and not the video, I&#039;d like to show the video on the homepage so you can play it right from there if possible?

Thank you.]]></description>
